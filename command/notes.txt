Reduce coupling between classes that call one another and make code more reusable

Example Drawing Application:
Clear canvas

editor->clearAll()->strokes = [];

functions are replaced with command objects;

Class structure could look something like the following:
A Command Interface that has an execute method that must be overriden by the concrete implementations
The concrete implementation can use any data in addition to the class pointer that the command is supposed to go in


The end result is the calling classes don't need to know about the implementation of the class that has the commands in it.
